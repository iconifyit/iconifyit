## Objective
I would like to find a senior software engineer position that will allow me to work remotely from anywhere, primarily in Europe/France. My wife and I have dreamed of moving to France ever since we met 11 years ago and now is the time in our lives to make the move.

## My Background
I went to school to be a graphic designer, Illustrator, and art director. But, truth be told, I did not enjoy making art for a living. In 1998 I started dabbling with code and fell in love. In 2001 I made the decision to switch careers and have never regretted it. I am self-taught as a software engineer but have benefitted tremendously from open source code and coders, and some more experienced mentors who give me a shot and taught me some valuable lessons.

## What I'm Working On:
I always have ambitious side projects going on. Currently I am working on https://vectopus.com, a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace for buying and selling vector images. The site is built with an an ExpressJS REST API back-end hosted on Amazon AWS, a Next.js front-end also hosted on Amazon AWS, and verious serverless pipelines for high-volume batch processing using AWS Lambda + SQS. You can read more about the project in a series on my blog, https://sketchandbuild.com.

## What I am learning:
I am currently learning about how to integrate AI/ML into my projects.

## What I am most proud of:
I am most proud of my work on vectopus.com. I can't share most of the code publicly to protect the business's intellectual property but I am sharing as much of the code publicly via opensource licenses as possible. Check out my pinned projects above to see some exampls of code I'm proud of. Also, check out the SkyBlue CMS code. It is a bit old but, IMO, still very well-written. Before I moth-balled the project it had reached about 75,000 active installs. I shut it down because it wasn't really making any money and there are so many open source CMS that are better positioned to meet users' needs that there just wasn't a good reason to continue spending time on it. But I'm really proud of the code and product and it was a big part of how I taught myself to build software.

## What I do for fun:
My wife and I love to travel and have visited about 25 countries. I also like to draw and have studied art for most of my life. I am no Michaelangelo, but I'm not bad. I also love spending time with our dogs.

## What I am passionate about:
Outside of drawing and making things to improve people's lives, I am passionate about great ape conservation. I am kind of obsessed with all things great ape (gorillas, orangutans, bonobos, and chimpanzees). 

## My credo:
I don't really have a pithy motto but I believe strongly in personal integrity, hard work, kindness, empathy, and helping others. It is hard to go wrong if you helping others achieve the things you want for yourself.
